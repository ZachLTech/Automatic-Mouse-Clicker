# Automatic-Mouse-Clicker
This is a simple program I'm working on just for fun which has a GUI that allows you to insert an image of your choosing.
With this image you can activate the program that will start looking on your screen(s) to locate the image you inserted,
 once it finds this image it'll immediately move your mouse to it and click it.
You will also be able to use the GUI to customize what you want the program to do when if finds the image on your screen.

# HOW TO USE (What each button does):

Insert Image:

-Once pressed, choose the image you would
 like to be clicked. Then the file location
 of the image should show in the gray box.
 
 
Start Clicking/Detection Accuracy/Time Between Clicks:

 -Before clicking, you MUST input a decimal value
  In the “Detection Accuracy %” Box ranging between
  0 – 1.  
 -If you input a higher decimal such as 1, the program
  Will be more strict and only detect an exact match of
  Your inserted image
 -If you input a lower decimal such as 0.1, the program
  Will be less strict and detect anything on-screen 
  remotely similar to your inserted image.
 -Before clicking, you MUST also input a number in the
  "Time Between Clicks" box which will represent the 
  seconds in which the program will pause before clicking
  again if the inserted image is visible/found on-screen
 -Once Pressed, this program will find your inserted
  Image if/when it’s on screen before moving to it
  And clicking it.
 
 
Stop Clicking/Clear Image:

 -Pressing “Stop Clicking” will stop the program from
  Continuing to search and click your inserted image.
 -Pressing “Clear Image” will clear your inserted image
  Allowing you to add a new one to click.
